= Eerie array
Mi≈Çosz Chojnacki

Write a program which performs the following operations on an array of positive integers: +

. `A _n_` - adds number *_n_* to the array after the last one added by this command. Start from the beginning of the array. Print `FULL` if the array is full,

. `E` -  calculate and print the average of the stored numbers,

. `P` - print elements without repetitions in order of their first appearance,

. `M` - print index of the *_first existing_* element, whose sum of its *_existing_* neighbours is the greatest,

. `Q` - exit the program.

== Example

Input: +
`A 2` +
`A 1` +
`A 10` +
`A 5` +
`A 1` +
`A 5` +
`E` +
`P` +
`M` +
`Q` +

Output: +
`4` +
`2 1 10 5` +
`1`

== Notes

Size of the array for tests is at most *1000*, but it should be easy to change in the code. Make sure that the program doesn't allow the user to leave the bounds of an array. Operation `M` appears after at least one operation `A`.

Try to split different parts of program into separate functions
